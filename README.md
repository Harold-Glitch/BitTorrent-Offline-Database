# BitTorrent-Offline-Database

Only two files to search millions of torrents sorted by type, date, size, filenumber, seeders and leechers.
Unzip the two files in a directory and just click on index.html all is included.

The result is a full text fast search engine among torrents names.

The full database of almost 3 million records is udated on a regular base [see Releases](https://github.com/Harold-Glitch/BitTorrent-Offline-Database/releases/tag/1.0).
